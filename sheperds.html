            <h1>SWEET POTATO AND VENISON SHEPERD'S PIE</h1>

            <div class="recipe-details-info">
                <p><b>Price: </b>R160</p></br>
                <p><b>Serves only 1 person</b></p>
                <p><b>This luxurious shepherd's pie has a rich, meaty venison filling covered with fluffy, 
                    creamy mashed potatoes. It's as easy to make as the original recipe made with lamb 
                    (or beef for a cottage pie) and this homey and flavorful supper will delight everyone at the table. 
                    When cooked along with a variety of vegetables and port wine, the filling becomes hearty and flavorful, 
                    perfect crowned with creamy mashed potatoes and baked until golden and crispy on top. Because of the earthy 
                    quality of the meat, 
                    it's best served with red wine, like pinot noir, syrah, or zinfande</b></p>
